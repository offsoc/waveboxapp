<h3>Version 10.129.27 <span class="date">25/9/2024</span></h3>
<h4>üÜï New!</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    An all new, more capable link open engine with more flexibility to
    create global rules and tailor your Wavebox! We've added an all-new UI
    for rule management - no more hunting through apps to find where a rule
    was created. Wavebox now features an intuitive list (with search of course)
    so you can easily find and manage each rule.
    <br /><br />
    We've added robust support for cross-space rules across the board. If you need
    to move a link to a new space, Wavebox gives you the tools to do this!
    <br /><br />
    We've also made it easier to figure out when a rule is being applied, with
    a new indicator in the URL bar. This will show you which rule is being applied
    to the current page, and you can click on it to see more details.
    <br /><br />
    Rules now have support for more scopes (where they're opened from), with then new
    version allowing matches for:
    <ul>
      <li>Anywhere in Wavebox</li>
      <li>Typed into the Omnibox/Location bar</li>
      <li>Anywhere in a Space</li>
      <li>Anywhere in a Group</li>
      <li>From within an app</li>
      <li>Outside of Wavebox (if Wavebox is set as your default browser)</li>
    </ul>

    URL matching has been enhanced, making it simpler to create URL matches with support for:
    <ul>
      <li>Contains</li>
      <li>Starts with</li>
      <li>Equality</li>
      <li>Patterns</li>
      <li>Hostnames</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add more options to customize and re-order the items in the Group, App & Tab tooltips</li>
  <li>Add an experimental flag that allows groups with more than one spaces to either be displayed in both spaces or just one</li>
  <li>Add a helper for when using a group with multiple spaces</li>
  <li>Make it easier to create a custom app from toolbar by pre-filling a bunch of things based on the search</li>
</ul>
