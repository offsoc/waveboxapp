<h3>Version 10.104.7 <span class="date">3/8/2022</span></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Update to Chromium 104.0.5112.81</li>
  <li>
    Wavebox had a secret disco mode! You could sometimes trigger this
    when interacting with Groups that are in split screen, and you'd see tabs
    switching every half a second or so. Fun as disco mode was, it was actually a
    bug and not a feature. So the Wavebox dev team have been party-poopers and
    shut the disco down.
  </li>
  <li>Dragging apps into the Webdock and creating a group was broken, fix this.</li>
  <li>
    Fix an issue where the "This tab is sleeping" or "Add your first tab to the group"
    screen would end up in error.
  </li>
  <li>Update dependencies</li>
  <li>Stability fixes</li>
  <li>First launch improvements</li>
</ul>
