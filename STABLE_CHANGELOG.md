<h3>Version 10.104.7 <span class="date">3/8/2022</span></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Update to Chromium 104.0.5112.81</li>
  <li>
    Wavebox had a secret disco mode! You could sometimes trigger this
    when interacting with Groups that are in split screen, and you'd see tabs
    switching every half a second or so. Fun as disco mode was, it was actually a
    bug and not a feature. So the Wavebox dev team have been party-poopers and
    shut the disco down.
  </li>
  <li>Dragging apps into the Webdock and creating a group was broken, fix this.</li>

    screen would end up in error.
  </li>
