        Brainbox now remembers your conversations so you can drop back in to one at anytime
      </li>
      <li>
        Conversation flow is now better preserved so you can ask more follow-up questions
        and get better contextual replies
      </li>
      <li>
        More actions to help when chatting with Brainbox such as, stopping the reply, retrying
        the question, switching to a suggested app & more!
      </li>
      <li>
        Brainbox is now more date & time aware so you can, for example what the time in a different
        timezone is.

        You can now switch Brainbox engines from within the chat. By default Brainbox uses GPT-3.5,
