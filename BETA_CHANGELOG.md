    Wavebox had a secret disco mode! You could sometimes trigger this
    when interacting with Groups that are in split screen, and you'd see tabs
    switching every half a second or so. Fun as disco mode was, it was actually a
    bug and not a feature. So the Wavebox dev team have been party-poopers and
    shut the disco down.
  </li>
  <li>Dragging apps into the Webdock and creating a group was broken, fix this.</li>

    Fix an issue where the "This tab is sleeping" or "Add your first tab to the group"
    screen would end up in error.
  </li>
